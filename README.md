In this project, I cleaned a dataset of a housing details - Nashville Housing. The dataset consists of various attributes such as Property Address, Owner Address, Sale Date, Bedrooms, Tax Districts, etc. While cleaning the data set I implemented various SQL queries.

Queries include:
1. STANDARDIZING DATE FORMAT
2. POPULATE PROPERTY ADDRESS DATA
3. Breaking out Property Address into Individual Columns (Address, City, State)
4. ARRANGING OWNER'S ADDRESS
5. Change Y and N to Yes and No in "Sold as Vacant" field
6. REMOVING DUPLICATES
7. DELETING UNUSED COLUMNS
